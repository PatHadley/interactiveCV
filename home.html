				<tr>
					<td colspan="2">
						<p>This project followed on from the Wikimedia roles at York Museums Trust. YMT's management identified Intellectual Property Rights as the cause of the biggest obstacles to releasing open content: essentially, fear of infringing IPR makes it's impossible to effectively offer the public content through digital channels. I was commissioned to investigate the current IPR landscape within the collections and provide a 'road map' for the future of digital openness at YMT</p>

						<p>As Yorkshire’s Wikimedia Ambassador I worked with Museums Development Yorkshire to coordinate a county-wide project helping accredited museums engage with Wikipedia. This is part of a global initiative (GLAMwiki) helping galleries, libraries, archives and museums to work with Wikipedia, thus joining publicly/charitably funded knowledge repositories with the world’s 6th-most-popular website. The range of tasks involved was huge, requiring a proportionally diverse skillset. I was tasked with negotiating relationships between the museums - ranging from the National Media Museum to rural village-hall museums - and the Wikimedia community.</p>

I was also involved in the development of digitisation strategies and the careful management of digital objects. My contributions have aided in the development of YMT’s new public, online collection.</p>

						<h3>Director - Enkyad Heritage Media</h3>

					<td colspan="2">
						<p>Enkyad Heritage Media was a start-up company aiming to produce narrative 3D animations for archaeological and heritage sites. I led a team with illustrator Glenn Hustler and worked with dancers, writers, animators and other archaeologists on a pilot project based on the Mesolithic site of Star Carr. </p>
						<p>We were selected to be hosted by the University of Bradford’s business incubator and were supported by the University and city council.</p>
						<p>The team worked hard to develop the animation and built good relationships with heritage and arts organisations around Yorkshire. Unfortunately, we never gained sufficient funding to complete the project. The project was caught between arts and heritage organisations and I learned a great deal about the mechanics and subtleties of the funding processes in both.</p>
						<p>The challenges of the project forced me to develop better entrepreneurship and interpersonal skills, and be reliant on my own determination.</p>

						<p>This project was dedicated to learning why a significant period of British prehistory - the Mesolithic - has virtually no public recognition or understanding. Building on this, the project intended to develop strategies and tools to help engage the public with Mesolithic archaeology.</p>
						<p>After approximately 18 months I took a leave of absence from the project feeling frustrated with the limited social scope of its design and the restrictions of academia for innovative public engagement.
